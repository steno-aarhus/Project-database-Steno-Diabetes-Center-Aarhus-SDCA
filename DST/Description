## Population / Population

The data in the Project Database contains informations on the full population. When you set up your project under the Project Database the datamanagement team will 
do the population delimitation based on the definition in your project application. 

## Variabelindhold / Variables included

All variables can be de-identified (direct identification is not
needed). The list of requested variables is found in the tables at the
end of the document in the Appendix. For all the variables, we need the
data from the first year it is available to the most recent year it is
available.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(glue)
source(here("R/functions.R"))

needed_registers <- here("data/needed-registers.csv") %>%
  read_csv(col_types = "lddccccc") %>%
  filter(!drop | is.na(drop))

dst_variables <- read_csv(here("data/dst-registers-with-variables-to-use.csv"))
dst_variables <- dst_variables %>%
  filter(
    register_id %in% unique(needed_registers$register_id)
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("year"), str_extract, pattern = "^\\d{4}")) %>%
  mutate(start_year = case_when(
    is.na(variable_start_year) | variable_start_year == variable_end_year ~
      register_start_year,
    TRUE ~ variable_start_year
  )) %>%
  select(register_id, register_name_dk, variable_name, start_year)

sds_variables <- read_csv(here("data/sds-registers-with-variables-to-use.csv"))
sds_variables <- sds_variables %>%
  mutate(start_year = str_extract(periode, "^\\d{4}")) %>%
  select(register_name, table_name, variable_name, start_year)

random_registers <- read_csv(here("data/random-undocumented.csv"))

authorized_researchers <-
  read_csv(
    here("data/authorized-researchers.csv"),
    col_types = cols(.default = col_character())
  )

options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
```

Registers requested are:

```{r dst-register-list, results = "asis"}
needed_registers %>%
  filter(!is.na(register_id) & owner == "dst") %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ if_else(is.na(.), "TO UPDATE", .))) %>%
  glue_data("- {register_id}: {register_name_dk} / {register_name_english}") %>%
  sort() %>%
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

In the Appendix we listed the ATC codes from the prescription register
and ICD-8 and -10 codes from the patient register that we need to
classify diabetes and the diseases that may arise following a diabetes
diagnosis.

<!-- Please also include information on external data or own survey data if such -->

<!-- data is part of the project. In such cases please include approval from the -->

<!-- Danish Protection Agency. -->

## Særligt vedr. lægemiddelsdata / Especially regarding drug data

The medication data we are requested are used in order to identify cases
of disease (e.g. diabetes) that might not have been diagnosed and
recorded in the patient register. The list of requested ATC codes is
found in the Appendix section.

```{=html}
<!--
Only to be filled in if the project is to use drug data. Research projects that
must use data from the Medicines Database must be approved by the Danish Health
and Medicines Authority. The approval process takes place via a contact person
in Forskningsservice. Drug data may only be used for the purpose described in
this project setting. If drug data is to be used for other purposes, a renewed
approval from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority is required.

```
## Offentliggørelse af resultater / Publication of results

Results will be published in open access scientific outlets and
presented at scientific conferences.


## Data som ikke kommer fra Danmarks Statistik / Data that doesn't come from DST

Data coming from other sources (e.g. Sundhedsdatastyrelsen):
